This bill, the first of its kind in peacetime, was the start of a mass mobilisation campaign which would result in over 10 million young men being inducted into the US army within seven years[^1]. \n\nRobert Dorfman, a statistician and operational researcher who worked for the federal government and the army during the war[^2], was concerned with a logistical challenge presented by all these new recruits; screening them for the sexually transmitted infection syphilis. Although a blood test for syphilis existed, it was time and resource intensive to screen just one sample using this method[^3], let alone 10 million. In a 1943 paper, Dorfman proposed a scheme which could, in theory, dramatically reduce the number of tests that needed to be performed in order to screen all new enlistees for syphilis[^4]. Though his technique was not widely applied during the war[^5], his paper established 'group testing' as a new field of mathematical study, one which has gone on to have many biological and medical applications[^6].\n\n## Pooling Samples\n\n## How Many Tests?\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Plotting the Number of Subsets of Edges Against the Number of Edges in R\"}\npar(mar=c(bottom=4.2, left=5.1, top=1.8, right=0.9), family=\"Roboto Slab\") # setting the plot options\nnum_edges <- 1:12 \nplot(num_edges, 2^num_edges, pch=4, cex=1.8, lwd=4.8, col=\"#009ed8\",\n     xlab=\"Number of Edges of Graph\", ylab=\"Number of Subsets to Check\",\n     cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/exponential-growth-1.png){width=1152}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Group Testing Today\n\n## Further Reading\n\n[^1]: glass_fdr-signs-draft-act-sept-16-1940 (article)\n[^2]: green-jorgenson-rogers-and-stavins_robert-dorfman (article)\n[^3]: duso_the-origin-of-group-testing (blog post)\n[^4]: dorfman_the-detection-of-defective-members-of-large-populations\n[^5]: johnson_numbercrunch (book)\n[^6]: aldridge-et-al_group-testing (paper)",
